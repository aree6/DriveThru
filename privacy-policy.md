# DriveThru Extension Privacy Policy

## Single Purpose Description
DriveThru is a Chrome extension that enhances the Google Drive viewing experience by providing local file viewing capabilities and improved download management. It allows users to preview and download files directly from Google Drive with additional controls and features for a better user experience.

## Permission Justifications

### Storage Justification
Storage permission is required to save user preferences and maintain extension settings between browser sessions. This ensures a consistent user experience and remembers user-selected options for file handling.

### Downloads Justification
Downloads permission is necessary for the core functionality of the extension - managing and initiating file downloads from Google Drive. This allows the extension to handle file downloads and provide re-download capabilities when needed.

### Tabs Justification
Tabs permission is required to detect when users are viewing Google Drive files and to inject the necessary interface elements (like the re-download button) into the appropriate tabs.

### Notifications Justification
Notifications permission is used to inform users about the status of their downloads and file operations, providing important feedback about successful downloads or any potential errors.

### Scripting Justification
Scripting permission is necessary to inject our custom interface elements into Google Drive pages and handle user interactions with these elements, such as the re-download button functionality.

### Host Permission Justification
Host permissions for Google Drive domains are required to integrate with Google Drive's interface and provide our enhanced viewing and download capabilities. This permission is strictly limited to Google Drive domains and is essential for the core functionality of the extension.
